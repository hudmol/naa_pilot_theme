                           This branch contains enhancements that the series system plugin depends on. It has been
                           submitted as a pull request and so will hopefully not be required in future releases.

                           The series system plugin, originally developed as part of the QSA project is installed.
                           It is deployed from a

                           This branch contains some minor changes to remove QSA-specific content.
